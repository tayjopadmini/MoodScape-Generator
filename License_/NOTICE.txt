The MoodScape Generator https://github.com/tayjopadmini/MoodScape-Generator has been roughly adapted from Frederic Font's Freesound Timeline available at https://github.com/ffont/freesound-timeline
The Freesound Timeline was focused mainly on retrieving and playing sounds determined by their date of upload.

The MoodScape Generator adapts this idea to create soundscapes that are based on Moods.
The MoodScape Generator uses the ANEW dataset to retrieve words with a specific value of valence, dominance and arousal.

A set of functions have been added to retrieve this dataset and host it on the local server (onload(), createJSONData(), openANEW()).
There are functions that have been added to implement K- Nearest Neighbor algorithm searches on this dataset (getKNearestNeighbor(), euclideanDistance(), getSortOrder())
The retrieval functions have been changed to search for sounds based on moods / words rerieved from the dataset (search(),play())
There have been functions added to automate the generation of the soundscape once the user makes a choice of input (property_change(), wordselect())
