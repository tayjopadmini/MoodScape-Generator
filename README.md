# MoodScape Generator
MoodScape Generator was developed by Tayjo Padmini Vaduru as part of her Master's thesis at Queen Mary University of London co-supervised by Dr Mathieu Barthet, Dr Anna Xambo, and Alessia Milo.

Interactive version of the tool available at:
https://tayjopadmini.github.io/MoodScape-Generator/#0

Running from local machine:
The files required to run the tool are
freesound.js
audioengine.js
MoodScapeGenerator.html
slider.css
You will also need the ANEW2010All.txt file from the Affective Norm English Words (ANEW) dataset which you can request here: https://csea.phhp.ufl.edu/media/anewmessage.html

In order to host the file, the file should be in the same folder as the JavaScript and the HTML files. On the terminal or console at that folder, the Python command python –m http.server should be used for Python 3. For versions of Python below Python 3, the command is python –m SimpleHTTPServer.
Upon opening the browser, in the address bar the following should be entered;

Localhost:Port_number/Name_of_HTML_file_to _run

In this case:

http://localhost:Port_Number/index.html
